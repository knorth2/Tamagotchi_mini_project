//pseudoCode
//Make an alert and prompt to add name of bug and to give rules of game. 

//Event Listeners-Make start button that starts the game/timer?

//Create buttons to keep bug alive, hunger, play, sleep(lights on/off) with a 1-10 scale.  There will also be metrics keeping track of hunger, sleepiness, play/boredom, and age. 

//Create object with functions/methods with if/else if statements.

//Morphing will require bug to stay alive for how long? 120secs? Bug will die if hunger, play, and sleepiness hits 10.

//Create morphed bug? 2 or 3 stages with setAge function inside game object?

//What will you use to keep track of 120sec of life. A callback function/higher order function?

//Game ends when bug dies. Alert bug has died.

If any of the buttons reaches 10 your bug will die. So the more you interact with your bug the greater the chance you will keep it alive!
