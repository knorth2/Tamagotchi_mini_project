# Tamagotchi_mini_project
# HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript

This mini-project was a homework assignment in my software engineering bootcamp that I am currently attending through General Assembly. 
It uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to create a simple game that simulates Tamagotchi.
In this game, the user is able to feed, play and nap their own 'bug' and the ultimate goal is to keep it alive!
Follow the instructions and have fun!
